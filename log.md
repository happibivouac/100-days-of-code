# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 1st, 2018

*Progress*: Worked on the personal portfolio on FreeCodeCamp.

*Thoughts*: I'm struggling with coming up with a design that doesn't completely copy the site that they give as an example.

## Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

*Progress*: Continued work with the personal portfolio. Did further research into CSS and how to get the page looking how I really intended it, instead of an awful placeholder.

*Thoughts*: I learned some cool CSS things that I hadn't been taught through traditional means, but by going through so many different designs, I've started back at square one. So far I'm not off to a great start.

## Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

*Progress*: Struggled more. Will just make a basic site and retake the FreeCodeCamp challenges from the beginning.

*Thoughts*: I am off to an awful start with this. I'm frustrated at myself and how I can't retain this information. I know this happened because I was doing it, stopped, started working on Python, then JavaScript, and now I've come back to this and am lost. I will try to do FreeCodeCamp, straight through, with no interruptions of other languages/projects. At least until I am comfortable.

## Day 4: January 4th, 2018

*Progress*: Started over outside of the very basics. Currently working on CSS to hammer down the differences between padding, margin and focusing very hard on the small focus on jQuery.

*Thoughts*: Feeling more comfortable since I am going over the basics and able to see where I had made some mistakes. Looking forward to seeing what I'm able to come up with after continuing to go through with this restart.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
