# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: February 18th, 2019

**Progress**: Started working through *Head First Programming* and made it to Chapter 3.

**Thoughts**: Python is having a hard time sticking to my head at the moment, but I'm reworking through old and new projects to make it stick. I want to implement a difficulty level to the Guessing Game exercise that the book had me do to practice `else/if` statements more.

## Day 2: Feburary 19th, 2019

**Progress**: Learned about arrays and lists.

**Thoughts**: Having to learn about arrays, lists and then how to order the text all at once was a bit daunting. I think this should have been broken up into chapters instead of including it all in one.

## Day 3: Feburary 20th, 2019

**Progress**: Watched a YouTube video to further reiterate how functions and arrays work.

**Thoughts**: I think I need to slow down for a bit and focus on getting these core concepts figured out before I progress any further. I'm not confident in my ability with them yet and moving forward from here feels like I'll be having too much new information coming in that will make it harder to retain and train my brain to be efficent at what I've already been over. So Day 4 will be a study day over what I've already learned.

## Day 3: Feburary 21st, 2019

**Progress**: Study day on what I've learned so far: arrays, lists, functions, strings, ordering, methods and libraries.
**Thoughts**:
