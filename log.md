**Progress**: Started working through *Head First Programming* and made it to Chapter 3.

**Thoughts**: Python is having a hard time sticking to my head at the moment, but I'm reworking through old and new projects to make it stick. I want to implement a difficulty level to the Guessing Game exercise that the book had me do to practice `else/if` statements more.
